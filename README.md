# Technical Test
.Net core Web project (Blazor/Angular/React) to read the excel and attached xml data and display on screen (if we can display with the style in excel).

The template that needs to be read is “F 20.04” in the sheet and when merged with the data from the xml it should display the sheet as in “Final” tab.

Consideration needs to be given to Unit test, DI, logging, change to template etc.

Less hard coding so that solution is robust enough to handle a new template
